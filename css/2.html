        Pokémon is a Japanese media franchise that spans video games, animated
        television series and films, manga, a trading card game, merchandise,
        and various other forms of media. The franchise is set in a shared
        fictional universe where humans live alongside creatures called Pokémon.
        These creatures exist in hundreds of distinct species, each possessing
        unique abilities, elemental types, and evolutionary forms. Humans, known
        as Pokémon Trainers, catch, train, and battle Pokémon while also forming
        strong bonds with them. The franchise primarily targets children aged 5
        to 12, but its appeal extends to teenagers and adults worldwide. Pokémon
        has become the highest-grossing media franchise of all time, surpassing
        other major entertainment properties, and remains one of the most
        influential and best-selling video game franchises in history.

        Pokémon originated as a pair of role-playing video games developed by
        Game Freak, based on an idea by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Inspired by
        Tajiri’s childhood interest in collecting insects, the concept focused
        on exploration, collection, and social interaction. The first games were
        released for the Nintendo Game Boy on February 27, 1996, in Japan.
        Despite modest expectations, they became sleeper hits and gained
        popularity through word of mouth.

        Following the success of the games, Pokémon expanded rapidly into other
        media. A manga adaptation, a trading card game, and an animated
        television series were introduced, further broadening its audience. By
        the late 1990s, Pokémon had been exported internationally, triggering a
        global cultural phenomenon often referred to as “Pokémania.” During this
        period, Pokémon became deeply embedded in popular culture, particularly
        among children.

        Although the peak of Pokémania declined by the early 2000s, the
        franchise did not fade. Instead, Pokémon evolved into a long-running and
        consistently successful brand, with new video game generations, animated
        series, films, and merchandise released regularly. Each new generation
        introduces new regions, Pokémon species, gameplay mechanics, and
        storylines. In 2016, Pokémon experienced a renewed surge in global
        popularity with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality mobile
        game developed by Niantic. The game encouraged real-world exploration
        and social interaction, attracting millions of players and introducing
        Pokémon to a new generation of fans. Today, Pokémon continues to be a
        major force in entertainment, maintaining its relevance through
        innovation, nostalgia, and its enduring themes of friendship, adventure,
        and discovery.
