# HTML Fundamentals

A collection of topic-focused HTML files created to develop a strong understanding of core HTML concepts and document structure.

## Overview

This folder contains standalone HTML files that demonstrate essential features of the language, including semantic layout, text formatting, media elements, links, tables, and forms. Each file focuses on a specific topic and includes detailed comments explaining the purpose and behavior of the elements used.

## Files Included

### basic.html

Demonstrates general HTML fundamentals, including:

* Document structure and metadata
* Semantic layout (`header`, `main`, `footer`)
* Text elements and formatting
* Lists and tables
* Links and navigation
* Images, audio, and video
* Basic interactivity using JavaScript
* Inline vs block containers (`span` vs `div`)

---

### form.html

Focuses on HTML forms and user input elements, including:

* Text, password, email, and number inputs
* Dropdown menus and textareas
* File upload fields
* Radio buttons and checkboxes
* Form validation attributes
* Labels and accessibility considerations
* Submit and reset controls

## How to Use

For the best learning experience, view the files in two ways:

### 1. Run in a Web Browser

Open any file directly in a modern web browser to see the rendered page.

Example:

```bash
basic.html
form.html
```

No server or build tools are required.

### 2. Open in a Code Editor

Open the same files in a code editor or IDE to read the inline comments explaining each section and element.

Recommended editors include:

* Visual Studio Code
* Notepad++
* Sublime Text
* Any modern code editor

## Notes

* CSS files are included only for visual styling and readability.
* Styling is not part of the HTML learning content in this folder.
* Each file is self-contained and can be explored independently.
* This collection represents documented knowledge and project work. Additional skills and experience exist beyond what is included here.
