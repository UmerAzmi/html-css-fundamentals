# Image Gallery with Pagination

A multi-page image gallery built using HTML and CSS, featuring styled image cards, captions, hover effects, and page navigation.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a structured gallery layout that displays images across multiple pages with manual pagination controls. Each page presents a set of wallpapers with descriptive captions and links to full-size versions.

It represents one of the earliest HTML and CSS projects developed to practice layout design, styling techniques, and pagination using pure front-end technologies.

## Features

* Responsive image cards with captions
* Hover effects and visual feedback
* Background styling with fixed image
* Multi-page navigation
* Active page highlighting
* Previous, next, and home controls
* Font Awesome icons for navigation

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Flexbox for layout
* CSS variables for styling consistency
* Font Awesome (icons)

## How to Use

1. Open the main page in a web browser:

```bash id="bq49m4"
index.html
```

2. Use the pagination controls to navigate between gallery pages.

No server or build tools are required.
